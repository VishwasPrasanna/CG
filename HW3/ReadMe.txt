Following are the Sources that helped me in understanding the given problem at hand and I would like to acknowledge the following:
- "http://jsfiddle.net/HwR9N/3/" helped me to understand how key handling and key event works and helped me in retrieving the ASCII values of each key.
- "https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98foTJPJ_Ev03o2oq3-GGOS2" Big thanks to "The Cherno" who makes awesome contents for noobs like me.
- "http://math.hws.edu/graphicsbook/c7/s1.html" helped me with understanding a lot of stuff related to glMatrix and how the vertex shaders work with matrix transformation.
- Special Thanks to fellow classmate Harsh Agarwal in helping me understand and guiding me in what to do for parallel projection and Part 6 transformations.

extra credit work:
- I have kind of made use of vertex normals given in the json file for lighting the models, and the models donâ€™t look as disappointedly faceted as mentioned by Dr.Watson. I hope this is enough to get the extra credit of 1%.

Note:
- I had not implemented the index buffer in the last assignment due to which I lost 10 points. I have attempted a way at the index buffer and printed all the various buffer elements I'm creating in the console log.
