- The Html file to run the javascript code is named index.html.
- The javascript file needed to do raycasting is named raycast.js.
- For this assignment I have used "class Color" and "function getInputBoxes()" from the skeleton provided.
- Assumed that the JSON file for the box is always at https://ncsucgclass.github.io/prog1/boxes.json
- All the major formulas used related to ray casting are straight from the ray casting slides.
- Finally to run the code just place the "index.html" and "raycast.js" in the same folder and run index.html file.
